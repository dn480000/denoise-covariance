The notebook demonstrates the application of random matrix theory to tackle the difficulty in covariance matrix estimation with asset returns. We can separate signal from noise in covariance matrix estimation with the [Marchenkoâ€“Pastur law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marchenko%E2%80%93Pastur_distribution). Empirical tests with S&P 500 constituent return data show denoised covariance matrix generates superior out-of-sample performance in portfolio optimization.
